# Generating Monet Paintings via CycleGAN
This repository contains code to train a CycleGAN and analyze the results.

-----------
## Data 
- blabla
--------

## Use pre-trained model
- blablab
- blab
--------
## To train model: 
- Running main.py will train a model
- To tweak parameters you can select a subset of hyperparamters, by chaning the 
  index in the training step. 
- To monitor performance you can add your own Weight and biasis api-key. 
- 6 types of images will be generated during training:
  - Original photos
  - Generated Monet
  - Reconstructed 
  - Original Monet
  - Generated photo
  - Reconstructed Monet


-------
## Analysis
- The analysis conists of: 
  - A RGB comparison of images from a previous training with 3 different metrics 
    (MSE,PSNR,SSIM)
  - A grey-scale comparison of images from a previous training
  - A comparison of original photos and reconstructed photos
